    "By storing the device properties in `simulator`, we ensure that the appropriate basis gates and coupling map are used when compiling circuits for simulation, thereby most closely mimicking the gates that will be executed on a real device. In addition `simulator` contains an approximate noise model consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-qubit gate errors** consisting of a single qubit depolarizing error followed by a single qubit thermal relaxation error.\n",
    "* **Two-qubit gate errors** consisting of a two-qubit depolarizing error followed by single-qubit thermal relaxation errors on both qubits in the gate.\n",
    "* **Single-qubit readout errors** on the classical bit value obtained from measurements on individual qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the gate errors the error parameter of the thermal relaxation errors is derived using the `thermal_relaxation_error` function from `aer.noise.errors` module, along with the individual qubit $T_1$ and $T_2$ parameters, and the `gate_time` parameter from the device backend properties. The probability of the depolarizing error is then set so that the combined average gate infidelity from the depolarizing error followed by the thermal relaxation is equal to the `gate_error` value from the backend properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the readout errors the probability that the recorded classical bit value will be flipped from the true outcome after a measurement is given by the qubit `readout_errors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call `from_backend` to create a simulator for `ibmq_mumbai`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created a noisy simulator backend based on a real device we can use it to run noisy simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** When running noisy simulations it is *critical* to `transpile` the circuit for the backend so that the circuit is transpiled to the correct noisy basis gate set for the backend."
