# Quantum Double Anyon Braiding on a NISQ Device

Numerical simulations, done via Google Colab using Google Quantum's `cirq_google` package, are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bPn1ezCVAowkMWX3Pf2Iyu_kSI81uDz5?usp=sharing).

`/IBM` has code used on testing on IBM Quantum Cloud

`/Quantum double` has examples of analytical calcuations, e.g. calcualtion of $F-$ and $R-$symbols in the case of doubles of $D_4$, $Q_8$ and $S_3$.
